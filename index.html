<p> In order to become a legal administrator, one of the prerequisites to enter this industry, is to obtain an official New Zealand accredited qualification. This study is in line with the Australian guidelines and is an acceptable qualification to practice in either country.

This qualification is bound by New Zealand law and regulatory institutions and both demand a high standard of information security and upholding the greatest levels of privacy. 

Confidentially and commercial sensitivity are part of the curriculum and it is industry ethics and standard that potentially can and may cause some conflicts of interest. It is therefore of great essence, should any conflict arise, this is solved within the legal boundaries of finding a win win resolution when clients within the same law firm are represented, all whilst maintaining its privacy and security.

Within the legal sector, information must be stored in a particular way, for instance, the security of confidential information and other private documents must be electronically password protected to ensure that trust can be maintained to the public domain to achieve confidence and good faith towards the legal profession in New Zealand. It is shown in various areas in today’s code of conduct within the legal profession that all reasonable steps must be made to ensure such security systems are kept in check, an example of this could be in protection for crimes against fraud and so forth of which are regulated (CCCR: R11.4).

Legal representatives must adhere to the (Lawyers: Conduct and Client Care) Rules 2008 which states: a Lawyer has a duty to protect and to hold in strict confidence all information concerning a client, the retainer and the client’s business and affairs acquired in the course of the professional relationship. Within these rules, it continues to advise as to when disclosure of information is required, when permitted and of course Prohibited. 

New Zealand has been somewhat slow to acknowledge a right to privacy. for a long time, there was more of a basic display showed in relation to the topic of confidentiality. Privacy was recognised internationally in 1948 in art 12 of the United Nations’ Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states:
“No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks on his honour and reputation”.

Legislating for privacy was becoming more important since the 1970’s and 1980’s as computer technology vastly increased, this growth displayed a massive increase in activity for instance by ways of cyber threats, and the means of collection information and other information.

In 1980 New Zealand became a signatory to the OECD Guidelines on the protection of privacy and transborder flows of personal data. It wasn’t until 1990 that proper need for comprehensive legislation was recognised. The New Zealand government wished to carry out data matching to detect benefit fraud, and there was a need to manage the protection of civil liberties. (LexisNexis New Zealand Limited, 2019).

In 1993 New Zealand introduced The Privacy Act 1993 which in a long story short states that the purpose of the act is to promote and protect individual privacy. The act does not itself define “privacy” but more so, how to balance privacy information and of its terms reasonable steps to secure such privacy.
Under the 5TH Principle of the Privacy Act 1993 “Reasonable” one may ask what does reasonable mean? The steps required to be taken is based on the information acquired, so the level of security fluctuates depending on the level of risk involved. 

You can imagine that not only people, but organisations a like need to understand cyber risk and the best way to manage such, If security is weak it is almost impossible to maintain privacy, this could lead to identity theft, accidental release of information by staff, fraud, intentional employee leaks, hacker unauthorised access and malware attacks. (Darryl King, PARTNER; Claire Godber, SENIOR ASSOCIATE on August 23rd, 2016).

In summary, it is our human right to privacy that we must protect and with the mass growth you see developing in the technology world it is extremely important for all individuals and organisations to treat private information with the upmost care, so everyone can live and breathe a little easier given its expansion.</p>
